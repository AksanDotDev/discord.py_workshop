# Discord&#46;py Workshop
The March 9th Discord bot workshop for @HackSocNotts. 

A great chance to dip your feet into Discord bot building with one of the most powerful frameworks out there. 
Come and put your python skills to work, or dive in the deep end if you've not programmed in python before. 
We'll be looking the basics of a text based bot with a whistle stop tour around the basics of the API.
If you want to prep for this, make sure you have an up to date python 3 interpreter installed, a editor for coding and for bonus points go and set up a application/bot as a discord developer.
